# Name: REUSE-2
# Description: The first two lease requests are AR leases happening
#   at the same time, but with different images. The third one is
#   a best-effort one, using the image from the second AR request
#   (which should be scheduled on nodes P3, P4). The scheduler should
#   prefer scheduling the best-effort lease on P3, P4 since it
#   avoids an image transfer.
