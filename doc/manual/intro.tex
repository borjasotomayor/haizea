This document is The Haizea Manual, the primary source of documentation for the Haizea lease manager (\url{http://haizea.cs.uchicago.edu/}). Documentation on features that are in development can be found in our development website at PhoenixForge (\url{http://phoenixforge.cs.uchicago.edu/haizea}). 

This manual can be read as a tutorial introduction to Haizea or as a reference guide. To read it as a tutorial, read Chapters~\ref{chap:whatis} to~\ref{chap:quickstart} sequentially (if you are already familiar with what Haizea and resource leases are, you can skip directly to Chapter~\ref{chap:install}). Additionally, Chapter~\ref{chap:opennebula} provides both a tutorial-like introduction and a short reference guide on using Haizea with the OpenNebula virtual infrastructure manager (\url{http://www.opennebula.org/}). The remaining chapters and appendices are not meant to be read sequentially but, rather, consulted as a reference guide when information is needed on a specific option, functionality, etc.

If you need any help when getting started in Haizea, or need additional information on any of the contents of this manual, please don't hesitate to contact us through our mailing list. You can find instructions on how to subscribe on our website (\url{http://haizea.cs.uchicago.edu/}) in the ``Support'' page.
