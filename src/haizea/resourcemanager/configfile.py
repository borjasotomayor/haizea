            To avoid thrashing, Haizea will not schedule a lease unless all overheads

            However, this can still result in situations where a lease is prepared,
            and then immediately suspended because of a blocking lease in the future.
            The scheduling threshold factor can be used to specify that a lease must
            not be scheduled unless it is guaranteed to run for a minimum amount of
            time (the rationale behind this is that you ideally don't want leases

            as much time T as was spent on overheads (e.g., if preparing the lease requires
            60 seconds, and we know that it will have to be suspended, requiring 30 seconds,
            Haizea won't schedule the lease unless it can run for at least 90 minutes).
            In other words, a scheduling factor of F required a minimum duration of 
            F*T. A value of 0 could lead to thrashing, since Haizea could end up with
