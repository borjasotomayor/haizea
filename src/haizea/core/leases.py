"""This module provides the lease data structures:

* Lease: Represents a lease
* LeaseStateMachine: A state machine to keep track of a lease's state
* Capacity: Used to represent a quantity of resources
* Timestamp: An exact moment in time
* Duration: A duration
* SoftwareEnvironment, UnmanagedSoftwareEnvironment, DiskImageSoftwareEnvironment:
  Used to represent a lease's required software environment.
* LeaseWorkload: Represents a collection of lease requests submitted
  in a specific order.
* Site: Represents the site with leasable resources.
* Nodes: Represents a collection of machines ("nodes"). This is used

  needed by a leases.
