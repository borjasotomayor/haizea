"""Haizea uses a policy manager that allows certain scheduling decisions to
be delegated to pluggable policies. This is done so scheduling policies
can be (1) modified without having to modify core components of Haizea, and
(2) implemented by writing a single Python class that implements a given
interface for pluggable policies.

Three policies are currently pluggable: lease preemptability ("Can lease X
preempt lease Y?"), host selection ("I want to deploy a VM, what host should
I select for this?") and lease admission ("Should I accept/reject this lease
request?"). Haizea provides several simple policy modules in the
haizea.policies package. The policy to use is selected in the configuration
file. See the Haizea Documentation for more details on how this is done.

This module provides Haizea's policy manager and the base classes for
pluggable policies.
