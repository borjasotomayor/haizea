    """Haizea's default greedy mapper
    
    Haizea uses a greedy algorithm to determine how VMs are mapped to
    physical resources at a specific point in time (determining that point
    in time, when using best-effort scheduling, is determined in the lease
    and VM scheduling classes). 
    
    The way the algorithm works is by, first, greedily ordering the
    physical nodes from "most desirable" to "least desirable". For example,
    a physical node with no leases scheduled on it in the future is preferable
    to one with leases (since this reduces the probability of having to
    preempt leases to obtain a mapping). This ordering, however, is done by the 
    policy engine (see the GreedyPolicy class in the host_selection module) so, 
    to be a truly greedy algorithm, this mapper must be used in conjunction with 
    the "greedy" host selection policy).
    
    Then, the algorithm traverses the list of nodes and tries to map as many
    lease nodes into each physical node before moving on to the next. If
    the list of physical nodes is exhausted without finding a mapping for all
    the lease nodes, then the algorithm tries to find a mapping by preempting
    other leases.
    
    Before doing this, the mapper must first determine what leases could be
    preempted. This decision is delegated to the policy engine, which returns
    a list of leases ordered from "most preemptable" to "least preemptable".
    The mapper attempts a mapping assuming that the first lease is going
    to be preempted, then assuming the first and the second, etc.
    
    If no mapping is found with preemption, then there is no mapping at the
    requested time.
