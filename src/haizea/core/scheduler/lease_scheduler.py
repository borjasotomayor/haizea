"""This module provides the main classes for Haizea's lease scheduler, particularly
the LeaseScheduler class. This module does *not* contain VM scheduling code (i.e.,
the code that decides what physical hosts a VM should be mapped to), which is
located in the vm_scheduler module. Lease preparation code (e.g., image transfer 
scheduling) is located in the preparation_schedulers package. In fact, the
main purpose of the lease schedule is to orchestrate these preparation and VM
schedulers.

This module also includes a Queue class and a LeaseTable class, which are used
by the lease scheduler.
