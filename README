---------------------- INSTALLING HAIZEA ----------------------------

Haizea has been tested only on Unix systems, and these installation 
instructions are given with a Unix system in mind. However, Haizea 
includes no platform-specific code, and should run fine on other 
systems. If there is enough interest, we can produce installers and 
installation instructions for other platforms.

Installing Haizea can be accomplished in four simple steps:

1. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES

Haizea has a couple of software dependencies. Let's get them out of 
the way first:

    * Python 2.5. Haizea should also work with Python 2.4, but all 
      testing has been done on Python 2.5.
    * mxDateTime 3.1.0 (part of the eGenix.com mx Base Distribution).
    * Optional: pysqlite. This package is only necessary if you want 
      to use the OpenNebula modules.
    * Optional: Mako Templates for Python 0.2.2. This package is only 
      necessary if you want to automate running multiple simulation 
      experiments (if this doesn't make any sense, you can skip this 
      prerequisite for now; you will be pointed to this prerequisite 
      again in the documentation when you get to running multiple 
      experiments).
    * Optional: Psyco 1.6. This package optimizes the execution of 
      Python code, resulting in the simulation code running much 
      faster. You can skip this prerequisite if you are not going to 
      use Haizea to run simulations, or if you are only going to run 
      short simulations.

Note that mxDateTime, pysqlite, Mako, and Psyco are all available as 
packages (DEB, RPM, etc.) on most Linux distributions. If you don't 
install any of the optional dependencies, Haizea will still run fine, 
but some functionality may not be available, as noted above.


2. DOWNLOAD HAIZEA

Go to the download page and download the latest version of Haizea. 
This will be a tarball called haizea-XXX.tar.gz, where XXX will be the 
version number. For the remainder of the instructions, let's assume that 
you've saved this file in a directory called $HAIZEA_INST.


3. INSTALL HAIZEA

Go into directory $HAIZEA_INST and un-tar the installation package:

	tar xvzf haizea-XXX.tar.gz

This will create a directory called haizea-XXX in $HAIZEA_INST. Go into 
that directory, and as root, run the following:

	python setup.py install

If you do not have root access, or want to install Haizea in your home 
directory, run the following:

	python setup.py install --home=$HOME

Note: If you have never installed a Python package in your home directory 
before, make sure you set the environment variable PYTHONPATH 
appropriately so Python will be aware of the Haizea modules.

	export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/lib/python

After running the setup script, you should see a long list of installation 
and build messages, ending with the following:

	creating /usr/share/haizea/traces/multi
	copying traces/multi/inj1.lwf -> /usr/share/haizea/traces/multi
	copying traces/multi/inj2.lwf -> /usr/share/haizea/traces/multi
	copying traces/multi/withprematureend.lwf -> /usr/share/haizea/traces/multi
	copying traces/multi/withoutprematureend.lwf -> /usr/share/haizea/traces/multi
	running install_egg_info
	Writing /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/haizea-TP1.0.egg-info

If you see this, installation has been successful!


4. VERIFY INSTALLATION

Haizea includes some sample configuration files and lease request tracefiles 
that you can use to test Haizea. If you installed Haizea as root, you can run 
the following to test your installation:

	haizea -c /usr/share/haizea/etc/sample.conf

This will use a sample configuration file to simulate running the scheduler 
with no requests, resulting in the following (somewhat anticlimactic) output:

[2006-11-25 13:00:00.00] TRACE   Loading tracefile /usr/share/haizea/traces/sample.lwf
[2006-11-25 13:00:00.00] TRACE   Loaded workload with 0 requests (0 best-effort + 0 AR)
[2006-11-25 13:00:00.00] RM      Starting resource manager
[2006-11-25 13:00:00.00] CLOCK   Starting simulated clock
[2006-11-25 13:00:00.00] CLOCK   Stopping simulated clock
[2006-11-25 13:00:00.00] RM      Stopping resource manager
[2006-11-25 13:00:00.00] RM        Completed best-effort leases: 0
[2006-11-25 13:00:00.00] RM        Accepted AR leases: 0
[2006-11-25 13:00:00.00] RM        Rejected AR leases: 0

Ok, not terribly exciting, but if you see this then the basic machinery is 
working fine. To see how to do more elaborate simulations, take a look at 
the Quickstart Guide.

Note: If you installed Haizea in your home directory, you will have to run the 
following:

	haizea -c $HOME/share/haizea/etc/sample.conf

Additionally, you will have to modify the tracefile option in the sample 
configuration so it will point to the sample tracefile located in 
$HOME/share/haizea/traces/sample.lwf (instead of under the /usr directory).
