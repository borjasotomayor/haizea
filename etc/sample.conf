#        GENERAL OPTIONS        #
#                               #
# ============================= #

[general]

# Option: loglevel
# Required: Yes
# Description: Controls the level (and amount) of 
#   log messages. Valid values are:
#     - STATUS: Only print status messages
#     - INFO: Slightly more verbose that STATUS
#     - DEBUG: Prints information useful for debugging the
#       scheduler.
#     - EXTREMEDEBUG: Prints very verbose information
#       on the scheduler's internal data structures. Use only
#       for short runs.
loglevel: EXTREMEDEBUG

# Option: mode
# Required: Yes
# Description: Sets the mode the scheduler will run in.
#   Currently the only valid values are "simulated" and
#   "opennebula". The "simulated" mode expects lease
#   requests to be provided through a trace file, and
#   all enactment is simulated. The "opennebula" mode
#   interacts with the OpenNebula virtual infrastructure
#   manager (http://www.opennebula.org/) to obtain lease
#   requests and to do enactment on physical resources.
#   See sample_opennebula.conf for description of
#   OpenNebula-specific options.
mode: simulated

# Option: datadir
# Required: No
# Description: This is the directory where statistics on
# the scheduler's run will be saved to (waiting time of leases,
# utilization data, etc.). If omitted, no data will be saved.
datadir: /home/borja/docs/uchicago/research/haizea/results

# Option: nodes
# Required: Yes
# Description: Number of nodes in the simulated cluster
nodes: 4

# Option: resources
# Required: Yes
# Description: Resources in each node. Five types of resources
#   are recognized right now:
#     - CPU: Number of processors per node
#     - Mem: Memory (in MB)
#     - Net (in): Inbound network bandwidth (in Mbps) 
#     - Net (out): Outbound network bandwidth (in Mbps) 
#     - Disk: Disk space in MB (not counting space for disk cache)
resources: CPU,1;Mem,1024;Net (in),100;Net (out),100;Disk,20000

# Option: imagetransfer-bandwidth
# Required: Yes
# Description: Bandwidth (in Mbps) available for image transfers.
#   This would correspond to the outbound network bandwidth of the
#   node where the images are stored.
imagetransfer-bandwidth: 100

# Option: suspendresume-rate
# Required: Yes
# Description: Rate at which VMs are assumed to suspend (in MB of
#   memory per second)
suspendresume-rate: 50

#      SCHEDULING OPTIONS       #
#                               #
# ============================= #

[scheduling]

# Option: backfilling
# Required: Yes
# Description: Backfilling algorithm to use. Valid values are:
#   - off: don't do backfilling
#   - aggressive: at most 1 reservation in the future
#   - conservative: unlimited reservations in the future
#   - intermediate: N reservations in the future (N is specified
#                   in the backfilling-reservations option)
backfilling: aggressive

# Option: backfilling-reservations
# Required: Only when backfilling == intermediate
# Description: Number of future reservations to allow when
#   using the "intermediate" backfilling option.
# backfilling-reservations: 4

# Option: suspension
# Required: Yes
# Description: Specifies what can be suspended. Valid values are:
#   - none: suspension is never allowed
#   - serial-only: only 1-node leases can be suspended
#   - all: any lease can be suspended
suspension: all

# Option: migration
# Required: Yes
# Description: Specifies whether leases can be migrated from one
#   physical node to another. Valid values are "True" or "False"
migration: True

# Option: what-to-migrate
# Required: Only when migration == True
# Description: Specifies what data has to be moved around when
#   migrating a lease. Valid values are:
#     - nothing: migration can be performed without transferring any
#                files.
#     - mem: only the memory must be transferred
#     - mem+vm: both the memory and the VM disk image must be
#               transferred
what-to-migrate: mem+vm

# Option: diskimage-transfer
# Required: Yes
# Description: Specifies if disk images must be transferred before the
#   start of a lease and, if so, how. Valid values are:
#     - none: No disk image transfer is required
#     - unicast: Disk image must be transferred, and we are limited to
#                using unicast (NOTE: Not currently supported)
#     - multicast: Disk image must be transferred, and we can multicast
#                  the transfer to multiple nodes at the same time.
diskimage-transfer: none

# Option: avoid-redundant-transfers
# Required: Yes
# Description: Specifies whether the scheduler should take steps to
#   detect and avoid redundant transfers (e.g., if two leases are
#   scheduled on the same node, and they both require the same disk
#   image, don't transfer the image twice; allow one to "piggyback"
#   on the other). There is generally no reason to set this option
#   to False.
avoid-redundant-transfers: True

# Option: diskimage-reuse
# Required: Yes
# Description: Specifies whether disk image caches should be created
#   on the nodes, so the scheduler can reduce the number of transfers
#   by reusing images. Valid values are:
#     - none: No image reuse
#     - image-caches: Use image caching algorithm described in Haizea
#                     publications
diskimage-reuse: none

# Required: No
# Description: Path to list of images to append to lease requests.
#   If omitted, the images in the tracefile are used.

# Option: injectionfile
# Required: No
# Description: Path to file with leases to "inject" into the
#   tracefile.

# Description: Specifies how many seconds will be alloted to
#   boot and shutdown of the lease.
#bootshutdown-overhead: 20

# Option: runtime-overhead
# Required: No (default is 0)
# Description: Adds a runtime overhead (in %) to the lease duration.
#runtime-overhead: 5
