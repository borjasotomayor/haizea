<p>Haizea is an open-source VM-based lease management architecture (if that sounds like a mouthful, take a look at our <a href="whatis.html">What is Haizea?</a> page). In a nutshell, Haizea is a piece of software that, in combination with the <a href="http://www.opennebula.org/">OpenNebula virtual infrastructure manager</a>, can be used to manage a Xen or KVM cluster, allowing you to deploy different types of <A href="whatis.html#leases">leases</A> that are instantiated as virtual machines (VMs). Haizea can also be run in simulation, providing a platform for experimenting with scheduling algorithms that depend on VM deployment or on the leasing abstraction.</p>
