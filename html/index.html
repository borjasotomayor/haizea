Haizea is hosted at the University of Chicago's PhoenixForge, a collaborative development environment for student projects. Since PhoenixForge is still under construction, some services are still not available (SVN, bug tracking, etc.). Please bear with us as we migrate to this new home. For now, this website should provide all the information you need to get started with Haizea. If you run into any trouble, don't hesitate to contact us using <a href="support.html">our mailing list</a>.

<p>Haizea is a virtual machine-based resource lease manager presented in the paper <a href="http://workspace.globus.org/papers/hpdc242s-sotomayor.pdf">Combining 
Batch Execution and Leasing Using Virtual Machines</a>. We are working on an open source release of Haizea, and we are aiming to have the Haizea website and SVN 
repository up and running by the first week of July 2008. If you would like to be notified when the website is launched, please provide your e-mail address in the form below.</p>
