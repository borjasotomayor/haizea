<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<p>The next version of Haizea will be TP1.2, due in early August 2008. This version will include the following improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>RPC interface so enactment backend can send asynchronous events to Haizea</li>
<li>Command Line Interface (CLI) to Haizea</li>
<li>More documentation on how to produce pretty graphs from Haizea simulations</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several improvements that are planned for upcoming versions (coming out in summer and fall of 2008, exact dates to be determined):</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for more types of leases</li>
<li>Basic server consolidation algorithms</li>
<li>Decoupling policy decisions from Haizea</li>
<li>Lease negotiation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Wish list</h2>
<ul>
<li>The slot table data structure is the only part of Haizea that I wish were not implemented in Python. This part of the scheduler becomes a performance bottleneck in the simulations (it's not a problem if you're running Haizea "in real time"). A C/C++ implementation could speed up simulations, and would allow us to more efficiently query the slot table.</li>
<li>The code to parse the config file is getting unwieldy and should be replaced by something that makes it easier to add new options and document those options.</li>
<li>Haizea currently saves all the data it collects (accepted/rejected requests, lease statistics, etc.) to a file when Haizea stops running. This is ok for simulations, but not particularly useful when Haizea is running as a daemon. The accounting code has to be rethinked so it can also periodically save information to disk (e.g., with rrdtool)</li>
<li>Decoupling the notion of "deployment overhead" with "transferring a VM image". Although transferring a VM image is a common way of "setting up" a VM, there are other ways of deploying a VM (such as having a base image installed on all physical nodes and installing packages on them). Ideally, the scheduler should be able to interface with a "deployment overhead" module that will be the "expert" in deployment (however, the scheduler is still in charge of scheduling the overhead, but it consults with the overhead module to determine when the overhead can be scheduled, what nodes are preferable if we want to minimize overhead, etc.). This has been partially done starting with TP 1.1.</li>
<li>The source code is still in need of some general clean-up and documentation. This is slowly getting done.</li>
</ul>
